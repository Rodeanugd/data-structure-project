 The following project is an implementation of the Matrix Abstract Data Type onto a Doubly Linked List
 To illustrate how it performs, I used it to solve a simple problem: getting the shortest path between two cities in a country, where the roads between cities and their lengths  # were represented using a graph. 
 It solves the problem using a simple dijkstra-like algorithm (in O(n^2) complexity).
 In the example.in file, the first line represents the number of edges(roads) on the graph, the second is the starting city, the third is the destination. They are followed by an   empty line, after which all the edges(roads) are represented in the following format: "[city1] [city2] [distance]".
 The program then prints the shortest route, and the number of kilometers of said route.
